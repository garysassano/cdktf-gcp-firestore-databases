# cdktf-gcp-firestore-databases

CDKTF app that deploys two Firestore databases in the same GCP project.

This repository showcases a recently added new feature which allows to have [multiple Firestore databases within the same GCP project](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/manage-multiple-firestore-databases-in-a-project) (also of different types). Previously you were limited to a single Firestore database per project, always named `(default)`.
